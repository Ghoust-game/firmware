# Firmware of the GHOUST game

The firmware is the software that runs on the controllers

It was written in C++ for **ARDUINO** and depends on a rather long list of Frameworks and Libraries.

Setting up a working development environment for Arduino requires some steps that will be documentated at the [wiki](https://github.com/Ghoust-game/firmware/wiki/Firmware)
